            <strong>Product Image Carousel:</strong>
            <p>Implement a product image carousel on the Product Details pages (e.g., Product1.html, Product2.html) to allow users to view multiple images of the product. This enhances the user experience by providing a closer look at the product from different angles.</p>
            <p>Example: You can check out the image carousel on the [Amazon product pages](https://www.amazon.com/), where you can scroll through multiple product images.</p>

            <strong>Real-time Cart Updates:</strong>
            <p>Dynamic updates to the shopping cart can be seen on websites like [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/). When you add or remove items from your cart, the cart total and contents are instantly updated without requiring a page refresh.</p>

            <p>Most modern websites are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. A good example is [Nike's website](https://www.nike.com/), which provides a seamless shopping experience on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
            <p>Example: [Nike's website](https://www.nike.com/) is a great example of responsive design.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Contact Form:</strong>
            <p>Websites often include contact forms for user inquiries. You can explore the contact forms on [Apple's Support page](https://support.apple.com/contact) or [Google's Contact Us page](https://support.google.com/).</p>
            <p>Example: Check out the contact forms on [Apple's Support page](https://support.apple.com/contact).</p>
